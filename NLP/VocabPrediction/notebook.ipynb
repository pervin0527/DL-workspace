iii outside japan , is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by sega and media . vision for the playstation portable . released in january 2011 in japan , it is the third game in the valkyria series . <unk> the same fusion of tactical and real @-@ time gameplay as its predecessors , the story runs parallel to the first game and follows the nameless , a penal military unit serving the nation of gallia during the second europan war who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the imperial unit <unk> raven . <eos> the game began development in 2010 , carrying over a large portion of the work done on valkyria chronicles ii . while it retained the standard features of the series , it also underwent multiple adjustments , such as making the game more <unk> for series newcomers . character designer <unk> honjou and composer hitoshi sakimoto both returned from previous entries , along with valkyria chronicles ii director takeshi ozawa . a large team of writers handled the script . the game ' s opening theme was sung by may ' n . <eos> it met with positive sales in japan , and was praised by both japanese and western critics . after release , it received downloadable content , along with an expanded edition in november of that year . it was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series . due to low sales of valkyria chronicles ii , valkyria chronicles iii was not localized , but a fan translation compatible with the game ' s expanded edition was released in 2014 . media . vision would return to the franchise with the development of valkyria azure revolution for the playstation 4 . <eos> <eos> = = gameplay = = <eos> <eos> as with previous <unk> chronicles games , valkyria chronicles iii is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through <unk> text . the player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely <unk> through and replayed as they are unlocked . the route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player ' s approach when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . after the game ' s completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . there are also love simulation elements related to the game ' s two main <unk> , although they take a very minor role . <eos> the game ' s battle system , the <unk> system , is carried over directly from <unk> chronicles . during missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . a character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns . each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their action <unk> . up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . during gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( hp ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . each character has specific potentials , skills unique to each character . they are divided into personal potential , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and battle potentials , which are grown throughout the game and always grant <unk> to a character . to learn battle potentials , each character has a unique masters table , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . characters also have special <unk> that grant them temporary <unk> on the battlefield kurt can activate direct command and move around the battlefield without <unk> his action point gauge , the character <unk> can shift into her valkyria form and become <unk> , while imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . <eos> troops are divided into five classes scouts , <unk> , engineers , <unk> and armored soldier . <unk> can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class . with victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games ' method of distributing to different unit types . <eos> <eos> = = plot = = <eos> <eos> the game takes place during the second europan war . gallian army squad 422 , also known as the nameless , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign <unk> , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and <unk> officially referred to by numbers . <unk> by the gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the regular army and militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , <unk> <unk> , meaning always ready . the three main characters are <unk> kurt irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ace <unk> imca , a female darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the valkyria who destroyed her home and <unk> riela <unk> , a seemingly <unk> young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the valkyria . together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious imperial unit known as calamity raven , consisting of mostly darcsen soldiers . <eos> as the nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the gallian army exploit the concept of plausible <unk> in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make gallia lose face in the war . while at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . one such member , <unk> , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of calamity raven , attached to the ideal of darcsen independence proposed by their leader , dahau . at the same time , elements within gallian army command move to erase the nameless in order to protect their own interests . <unk> by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the gallian war effort . this continues until the nameless ' s commanding officer , ramsey crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of <unk> in order to present evidence <unk> the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the gallian general that had accused kurt of treason . <eos> <unk> due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the empire , the nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the gallian army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force . this is short @-@ lived , however , as following maximilian ' s defeat , dahau and calamity raven move to activate an ancient <unk> super weapon within the empire , kept secret by their benefactor . without the support of maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with gallia , it is dahau ' s last <unk> card in creating a new darcsen nation . as an armed gallian force invading the empire just following the two nations ' cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , kurt decides to once again make his squad the nameless , asking crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action . now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts dahau and destroys the <unk> weapon . each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives <unk> . <eos> <eos> = = development = = <eos> <eos> concept work for valkyria chronicles iii began after development finished on valkyria chronicles ii in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . the director of valkyria chronicles ii , takeshi ozawa , returned to that role for valkyria chronicles iii . development work took approximately one year . after the release of valkyria chronicles ii , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . like its predecessor , valkyria chronicles iii was developed for playstation portable this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for valkyria chronicles ii , and they had not come up with the revolutionary idea that would warrant a new entry for the playstation 3 . speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered valkyria chronicles iii to be the series ' first true sequel while valkyria chronicles ii had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of valkyria chronicles ii due to being on the same platform . in addition to sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by <unk> the original scenario was written <unk> <unk> , while the script was written by hiroyuki <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor . <eos> the majority of material created for previous games , such as the <unk> system and the design of maps , was carried over . alongside this , improvements were made to the game ' s graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . a part of this upgrade involved creating unique <unk> models for each character ' s body . in order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . they also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay . the newer systems were decided upon early in development . the character designs were done by <unk> honjou , who had worked on the previous valkyria chronicles games . when creating the nameless squad , honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the valkyria chronicles world . the main color of the nameless was black . as with the previous valkyria games , valkyria chronicles iii used the <unk> graphics engine . the anime opening was produced by production i . g . <eos> <eos> = = = music = = = <eos> <eos> the music was composed by hitoshi sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous valkyria chronicles games . when he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other valkyria chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . an early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . he <unk> the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to <unk> the game . the main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before <unk> segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . the rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game ' s ending . the battle themes were designed around the concept of a modern battle divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of <unk> . while sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . the guitar was played by <unk> <unk> , who also arranged several of the later tracks . the game ' s opening theme song , if you wish for . . . ( <unk> , <unk> kimi <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , was sung by japanese singer may ' n . its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty . its lyrics were written by <unk> <unk> , who had worked on may ' n on previous singles . <eos> <eos> = = = release = = = <eos> <eos> in september 2010 , a teaser website was revealed by sega , hinting at a new valkyria chronicles game . in its september issue , famitsu listed that senjō no valkyria 3 would be arriving on the playstation portable . its first public appearance was at the 2010 tokyo game show ( tgs ) , where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees . during the publicity , story details were kept <unk> so as not to <unk> too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . to promote the game and detail the story leading into the game ' s events , an episodic flash visual novel written by <unk> began release in january 2011 . the game was released january 27 , 2011 . during an interview , the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content ( dlc ) , but that no plans were finalized . multiple dlc maps , featuring additional missions and <unk> characters , were released between february and april 2011 . an expanded edition of the game , valkyria chronicles iii extra edition , released on november 23 , 2011 . <unk> and sold at a lower price than the original , extra edition game with seven additional episodes three new , three chosen by staff from the game ' s dlc , and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus . people who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions . <eos> unlike its two predecessors , valkyria chronicles iii was not released in the west . according to sega , this was due to poor sales of valkyria chronicles ii and the general unpopularity of the psp in the west . an unofficial fan translation patch began development in february 2012 players with a copy of valkyria chronicles iii could download and apply the patch , which translated the game ' s text into english . <unk> with the extra edition , the patch was released in january 2014 . <eos> <eos> = = reception = = <eos> <eos> on its day of release in japan , valkyria chronicles iii topped both platform @-@ exclusive and multi @-@ platform sales charts . by early february , the game sold 102 @ , @ <unk> units , coming in second overall to the last story for the wii . by the end of the year , the game had sold just over 152 @ , @ 500 units . <eos> famitsu enjoyed the story , and were particularly pleased with the improvements to gameplay . japanese gaming site game watch <unk> , despite negatively noting its pacing and elements recycled from previous games , was generally positive about its story and characters , and found its gameplay entertaining despite off @-@ putting difficulty spikes . <unk> writer <unk> <unk> , in a play test article based on the game ' s <unk> demo , felt that valkyria chronicles iii provided a profound feeling of closure for the valkyria chronicles series . he praised its gameplay despite annoying limitations to aspects such as special abilities , and positively noted its shift in story to a tone similar to the first game . <eos> playstation official magazine - uk praised the story ' s <unk> of gallia ' s moral standing , art style , and most points about its gameplay , positively noting the latter for both its continued quality and the tweaks to balance and content . its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes , something that had affected the previous games . heath hindman of gaming website playstation <unk> praised the addition of non @-@ linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from valkyria chronicles ii in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games . he also positively noted the story ' s serious tone . points criticized in the review were recycled elements , awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason , pacing issues , and occasional problems with the game ' s ai . <eos> in a preview of the tgs demo , ryan geddes of ign was left excited as to where the game would go after completing the demo , along with enjoying the improved visuals over valkyria chronicles ii . kotaku ' s richard <unk> was highly positive about the game , citing is story as a return to form after valkyria chronicles ii and its

. arsenal building , is a building located in macarthur park in downtown little rock , arkansas . built in 1840 , it was part of little rock ' s first military installation . since its decommissioning , the tower building has housed two museums . it was home to the arkansas museum of natural history and antiquities from 1942 to 1997 and the macarthur museum of arkansas military history since 2001 . it has also been the headquarters of the little rock æsthetic club since 1894 . <eos> the building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower . besides being the last remaining structure of the original little rock arsenal and one of the oldest buildings in central arkansas , it was also the birthplace of general douglas macarthur , who became the supreme commander of us forces in the south pacific during world war ii . it was also the starting place of the camden expedition . in 2011 it was named as one of the top 10 attractions in the state of arkansas by <unk> <eos> <eos> = =

were passing through the state on their way to the newly established oklahoma territory . thirty @-@ six acres were appropriated on the outskirts of little rock by major robert b . lee of the u . s . army . the land had been previously used as a racetrack by the local jockey club . john <unk> walker , a builder for the federal government , supervised the construction . originally $ 14 @ , @ 000 was allocated for the construction of the arsenal , but proved inadequate . the budget was later increased to $ 30 @ , @ 000 . work began on the tower building in 1840 , and it was the first permanent

called for it to be built of stone , however , masonry was used instead . the arkansas gazette referred to the structure as a splendid specimen of masonry . <eos> <eos> = = civil war = = <eos> <eos> for several years the arsenal , which was owned by the federal government , served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with only a handful of soldiers . but in november 1860 , with the american civil war on the horizon , a company of the second united states artillery , consisting of sixty @-@ five men , was transferred to little rock under the command of captain james totten . on january 15 , 1861 , the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of <unk> and to elect delegates to such a convention . it was planned for february 18 however , events at the arsenal , would not wait . on january 28 , then governor henry massey rector informed captain totten that he and his soldiers would be permitted to remain in the possession of the federal officers until the state , by authority of the people , shall have determined to <unk> their connection with the general government , totten responded to this by telling the governor that his orders came from the united states government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and <unk> asking for reinforcements , although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming . the first telegraph wire to span between little rock and memphis had recently been completed . local attorney john m harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from arkansas ' s capital . in his message , harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the little rock arsenal . <eos> the united states troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at fort smith . the garrison at fort smith had been previously transferred to the united states arsenal in this city ( little rock ) . the arsenal is one of the richest <unk> of military stores in the united states and is supposed to be the ultimate destination of the <unk> [ sic ] ordered from the frontier . <eos> <unk> m harrel <unk> , january 31 , 1861 <eos> the item was intended simply as a piece of news , but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state , <unk> procession sentiment . the rumor was interpreted by some <unk> as a call from the governor to assemble to help expel the federal troops from the arsenal . by february 5 , six militia units , consisting of 1 @ , @ 000 men , with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5 @ , @ 000 if the situations deemed it necessary , had assembled in little rock . governor rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops . faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of little rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops , governor rector was forced to take control of the situation . on february 6 , he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to captain totten , <eos> this movement is prompted by the feeling that <unk> the citizens of this state that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the arsenal should be under the control of the state authorities , in order to their security . this movement , although not authorized by me , has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty , as the executive of this <unk> , to <unk> my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the state and the federal troops under your command . i therefore demand in the name of the state the delivery of the possession of the arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the state authorities , to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of march next . <eos> perhaps because abraham lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as president , captain totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops . he agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions <eos> the governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the united states . <eos> the soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war . <eos> the soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders , not as conquered and surrendering soldiers . <eos> on the morning of february 8 , 1861 , rector and totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials . that afternoon , the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with governor rector at its head . all of the federal troops had left at this point , except totten who had stayed behind to listen to the governor ' s speech and to hand the arsenal over in person . <eos> the little rock arsenal was classified in 1860 as an arsenal of deposit , meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis . thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs , nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the arsenal fell into state hands . most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the arkansas military board . <eos> inside the little rock arsenal after its seizure in february , 1861 , the confederates <unk> some 10 @ , @ 247 weapons , 250 @ , @ 000 musket cartridges , and 520 @ , @ 000 percussion caps , as

there were only 1 @ , @ 364 percussion weapons available . <unk> of the weapons found in the arsenal is somewhat sketchy , but from various records it can be surmised that the 5th , 6th , 7th , and 8th arkansas infantry regiments , mustered in june , 1861 , were issued <unk> / m1822 . 69 caliber <unk> . the 9th and 10th arkansas , four companies of kelly ' s 9th arkansas battalion , and the 3rd arkansas cavalry regiment were issued flintlock hall ' s rifles . the units comprising the infantry force of van dorn ' s army of the west were the 1st and 2nd arkansas mounted rifles were also armed with m1822 <unk> from the little rock arsenal . by the time the 11th and 12th arkansas infantry regiments mustered in at little rock , the supply of arms had been almost completely exhausted , and only old <unk> weapons were left . <eos> most of the equipment , arms , and machinery at the little rock arsenal was removed to east of the mississippi river by order of <unk> gen . earl van dorn in april and may 1862 , and accountability for it is lost at that point . by all appearances , the equipment was sent down the river to napoleon , arkansas , and from there to jackson mississippi , where it was probably destroyed during the <unk> campaign in the early summer of 1863 . <eos> major general thomas c . hindman , sent to command the district of arkansas in may , 1862 , found the state nearly destitute of military material . hindman established another armory at arkadelphia , and revived the little rock arsenal as a collection point and depot for <unk> and ammunition manufacture for small arms . hindman recorded <eos> machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms , and both were turned out in small quantity , but of excellent quality . lead mines were opened and worked , and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the ordnance department and in the manufacture of <unk> , <unk> oil , spirits of <unk> , the various <unk> of iron , and other valuable medicines . most of these works were located at or near arkadelphia on the <unk> river , 75 miles south from little rock . the tools , machinery , and the material were gathered <unk> or else made by hand labor . nothing of this sort had been before attempted on government account in arkansas to my knowledge , except for the manufacture of small arms , the machinery for which was taken away by general van dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings <unk> a further supply , along with lead and caps , was procured from the citizens of little rock and vicinity by donation , purchases , and <unk> . <eos> this ammunition , and that which i brought with me , was rapidly prepared for use at the laboratory established at the little rock arsenal for that purpose . as illustrating as the <unk> <unk> of material in the country , the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the state library for cartridge paper . <unk> were employed or conscripted , tools purchased or impressed , and the repair of the damaged guns i brought with me and about an equal number found at little rock commenced at once . but , after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men i decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against fitch and that i would lead the remainder - about 1500 - to <unk> ' l <unk> as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from little rock instead of <unk> and lances , with which most of them were armed . two days <unk> before the change could be effected . <eos> the confederate ordnance establishment at little rock was reactivated in august , 1862 . looking around for a suitable person to head this activity , general hindman turned to the confederate navy and borrowed lieutenant john w . dunnington . lt . dunnington was the commander of the gunboat <unk> <unk> , which had been brought to little rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad . dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at little rock , and although he continued to draw his pay from the confederate navy department , he was placed in charge of all confederate ordnance activities ( which included artillery functions ) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel . <eos> lt . col . dunnington ' s <unk> for the month of august , 1862 , at little rock arsenal , <unk> , are found in vol . 149 , chapter iv of the <unk> rebel ordnance records , and are most enlightening as to the scope of confederate ordnance activities at little rock during this crucial time . according to dunnington , when i assumed command at this post , all material had been removed to arkadelphia . there were no persons employed . no shops were open for repair of arms or for <unk> ammunition . material , tools , etc . , had to be procured as well as the employment of laborers . work commenced the last part of the month . <eos> the military force at little rock under dunnington ' s command consisted of four officers himself , major john b . <unk> , captain <unk> green , and 2nd lt . <unk> murphy . in addition to these , he had 20 enlisted men and a civilian force composed of a <unk> , 2 clerks , 3 <unk> for repairing small arms , a <unk> , 26 laborers in the ammunition laboratory , and a carpenter for making packing boxes . <eos> during the month of august , 1862 , the following work was performed <unk> one pair of musket bullet moulds 10 @ , @ 000 buck & ball shot cartridges repaired 750 <unk> , shotguns , and rifles received and repaired ordnance stores and <unk> performed guard , office , and police duties inspected <unk> at camden and arkadelphia . <eos> lt . col . dunnington continued to build up his works at little rock until november 1862 , when captain sanford c . faulkner ( composer of the arkansas traveler ) was placed in charge of the arsenal . dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the <unk> .

following months are that the standard ammunition made was . buck & ball , indicating that the . 69 caliber <unk> and shotguns remained the predominant caliber weapon in use , and of this , nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for flintlock weapons , indicating that no less than a sixth of the confederate troops in this vicinity were still armed with obsolete flintlock weapons . <eos> the <unk> of work done at little rock arsenal , <unk> continue at about the same pace and scale from august 1862 until august 1863 . <unk> to the summary for august , 1863 is the ominous <unk> , during the last week in the month , nearly all stores at the arsenal have been packed and sent to arkadelphia , in obedience to orders from chief of ordnance , district of arkansas . this then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from little rock , with the city being surrendered to the advancing federal troops of frederick steele ' s arkansas expedition on september 11 , 1863 . <eos> in 1864 , after little rock fell to the union army and the arsenal had been recaptured , general <unk> steele marched 8 @ , @ 500 troops from the arsenal beginning the

walls and stairs , some of which remain today , including the central staircase . in 1880 , douglas macarthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father , captain arthur macarthur , was stationed there . <eos> in the 1880s , the federal government began closing many small <unk> around the country in favor of smaller ones built near railroads for quick deployment . the

camden expedition of 1864 , the arsenal may be included in the camden expedition sites national historic landmark designated in 1994 . <eos> in 1942 , the tower building was renovated due to the

bottomed habitats off northern australia . reaching 24 cm ( 9 @ . @ 4 in ) in width , this species has a diamond @-@ shaped , grayish green pectoral fin disc . its short , whip @-@ like tail has alternating black and white bands and fin folds above and below . there are short rows of thorns on the back and the base of the tail , but otherwise the skin is smooth . while this species possesses the dark mask @-@ like pattern across its eyes common to its genus , it is not <unk> patterned like other maskrays . <eos> <unk> in nature , the plain maskray feeds mainly on <unk> shrimp and polychaete worms , and to a lesser extent on small bony fishes . it is viviparous , with females producing litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ( uterine milk ) . this species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls , which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build . as it also has a limited distribution and low <unk> , the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) has listed it as near threatened . <eos> <eos> = = taxonomy and phylogeny = = <eos> <eos> the first scientific description of the plain maskray was authored by commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation ( csiro ) researcher peter last in a 1987 issue of memoirs of the national museum of victoria . the specific name <unk> comes from the latin an ( not ) and <unk> ( marked ) , and refers to the ray ' s coloration . the holotype is a male 21 @ . @ 2 cm ( 8 @ . @ 3 in ) across , caught off western australia several <unk> were also designated . last tentatively placed the species in the genus dasyatis , noting that it belonged to the maskray species group that also included the <unk> stingray ( then dasyatis <unk> ) . in 2008 , last and william white elevated the <unk> group to the rank of full genus as neotrygon , on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic evidence . <eos> in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna , the plain maskray and the <unk> maskray ( n . <unk> ) were found to be the most basal members of neotrygon . the divergence of the n . annotata lineage was estimated to have occurred ~ 54 ma . furthermore , the individuals sequenced in the study sorted into two genetically distinct clades , suggesting that n . annotata is a cryptic species complex . the two <unk> species were estimated to have diverged ~ 4 @ . @ 9 ma the <unk> event was likely the splitting of the ancestral population by coastline changes

spiracles . the nostrils are elongated and have a skirt @-@ shaped flap of skin between them . the small mouth bears prominent <unk> at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor . small papillae are also found around the outside of the mouth . there are five pairs of gill slits . the pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed . <eos> the tail is short , barely exceeding the length of the disc when intact , and has a broad and flattened base leading to usually two <unk> spines . after the stings , the tail becomes slender and bears a long ventral fin fold and a much shorter , lower dorsal fin fold . most of the body lacks dermal denticles a midline row of 4 – 13 small , closely spaced thorns is present behind the spiracles , and another row of 0 – 4 thorns before the stings . the dorsal coloration is grayish green , becoming pinkish towards the disc margins there is a dark mask @-@ like shape around the eyes and a pair of small dark blotches behind the spiracles . the tail behind the stings has alternating black and white bands of variable width , ending with black at the tip . the underside is plain white and the ventral fin fold is light grayish

mostly caused by australia ' s northern <unk> <unk> , which operates throughout its range . although this species is discarded when caught , it is more delicate @-@ bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear . historically , this species may also have been negatively affected by japanese , chinese , and taiwanese <unk> that fished intensively off northern australia from 1959 to 1990 . these factors , coupled with the plain maskray ' s limited distribution and low reproductive rate , have resulted in its being assessed as near threatened by the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) . <eos> <eos> <eos> = 2011 – 12 columbus blue jackets season = <eos> <eos> the 2011 – 12 columbus blue jackets season was the team ' s 12th season in the national hockey league ( nhl ) . the blue jackets ' record of 29 – 46 – 7 [ note 1 ] was the worst record in the nhl for 2011 – 12 and the first time in franchise history they finished in last place . it also marked the third straight year that they missed the playoffs . consequently , they had the best chance to receive the first overall selection in the 2012 nhl entry draft lottery , but lost out to the edmonton oilers and received the second pick instead . <eos> the blue jackets began the year with the worst start in franchise history and the worst by any team in an nhl season in 19 years . after an 11 – 25 – 5 start , head coach scott arniel was fired and replaced by assistant coach todd richards . the poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of all @-@ star forward jeff carter , who was acquired with much fanfare during the off @-@ season . with the prospect of another rebuild looming the blue jackets ' captain and best player , rick nash , requested to be traded , though he would remain with the team for the entire season . <eos> the team was involved in a controversial loss to the los angeles kings , when the staples center clock appeared to freeze at 1 @ . @ 8 seconds allowing the kings time to score the tying goal , before winning in overtime . during the season columbus managed only two winning streaks of three or more games . one of which came towards the end of the year helping the blue jackets finish with 65 points , the third worst point total in franchise history . <eos> <eos> = = off @-@ season = = <eos> <eos> in the off @-@ season the blue jackets ' approach to building their team changed , moving from a team of young developing players into one with established players . the first deal general manager scott howson made was the acquisition of all @-@ star forward jeff carter on june 23 , 2011 . the deal sent <unk> <unk> , columbus ' first @-@ round draft choice , the eighth overall , and their third @-@ round pick in the 2011 draft to the philadelphia <unk> in exchange for carter . the trade received a positive response in columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside of their best player , rick nash . next , they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent james wisniewski . wisniewski scored a career high 51 points during the 2010 – 11 season , splitting time between the new york islanders and montreal canadiens . the point total was fifth @-@ highest in the league for defenseman scoring , tying tobias <unk> . the blue jackets came to terms with wisniewski , just an hour prior to the start of free agency , signing him to a six @-@ year , $ 33 million deal . <eos> columbus also traded former first round draft pick nikita <unk> to the ottawa senators for a third @-@ round pick in the 2011 draft . <unk> had failed to live up to expectations in columbus , playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals . prior to the start of the season , the blue jackets were questioned for not signing a veteran back @-@ up to starting goaltender steve mason , as the former calder memorial trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons . the blue jackets signed mark <unk> as the back @-@ up who had only 50 minutes of nhl experience prior to the start of the season . columbus did sign a veteran curtis sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their american hockey league ( <unk> ) affiliate , the springfield falcons . sanford had not played in the nhl since 2009 . during training camp , <unk> suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line @-@ up for a month . additionally , sanford suffered a groin injury , leaving allen york

<eos> after the first five games , all losses , jeff carter suffered a broken foot that kept him out of the line @-@ up for 10 games . while carter was injured , the blue jackets continued to lose games . in the eighth game of the year , they had a chance to end the losing streak against the ottawa senators . columbus held a 3 – 2 lead with under a minute to play . jason <unk> tied the game on a late power play , and with just 4 @ . @ 7 seconds remaining , milan <unk> notched the winning goal for the senators . the loss helped set a franchise record for <unk> with a 0 – 7 – 1 record to start a season . [ note 1 ] the losing streak came to an end three days later with a win over the detroit red wings . during the game , several milestones were reached . james wisniewski made his columbus debut , ryan johansen and john moore scored their first career nhl goals and grant <unk> had a career @-@ high three assists . columbus was unable to create any momentum from the win , however , and continued to struggle , culminating in a 2 – 12 – 1 record , which was the worst start to an nhl season for any team in 19 years . with the team struggling , management attempted to shake things up by making some roster moves . the first move was the acquisition of center mark <unk> from the pittsburgh penguins . next , they traded defenseman kris russell to the st . louis blues for nikita <unk> . as the clubs slow start continued , there were rumors that head coach scott arniel would be fired and replaced with ken hitchcock . hitchcock had previously coached the blue jackets to their only playoff appearance in club history and was still under contract with the franchise through to the end of the season . before any of these rumors came to fruition , the st . louis blues asked columbus for permission to hire hitchcock , which the blue jackets allowed . hitchcock began his blues coaching career with a 6 – 1 – 2 record in his first nine games , while columbus amassed a 6 – 13 – 3 record to start the season . <eos> during the same time frame as the hitchcock rumors , goaltender curtis sanford returned from his groin injury on november 13 . he made his first start of the season against the boston bruins , losing 2 – 1 in a shootout . sanford continued his strong play , posting a 3 – 1 – 2 record , 1 @ . @ 38 goals against average and <unk> save percentage over his next six games . sanford started 12 consecutive games before steve mason made his next start . the number of starts might not have been as numerous , but prior to the november 23 game , mason was hit in the head by a shot from rick nash during pre @-@ game warm @-@ ups and suffered a concussion . mason returned from his concussion after two games , making a start against the vancouver canucks . mason allowed only one goal in the game despite suffering from <unk> in the third period , temporarily being replaced by sanford for just over three minutes . columbus won the game 2 – 1 in a shootout , breaking a nine @-@ game losing streak to the canucks . after the game , arniel stated that sanford was still seen as the team ' s number one goaltender . however , mason started four of the next six games with the blue jackets going 0 – 5 – 1 during that stretch . <eos> <eos> = = = january – february = = = <eos> <eos> with the losing continuing , more rumors began to surface . unlike before , the rumors were about player moves rather than coaching changes . the majority of rumors were that the blue jackets would trade rick nash . while howson stated that he had never brought up trading nash in discussions , other teams had <unk> about his availability . nash stated that if columbus felt it would make the franchise better than he would be willing to waive his no @-@ trade clause . howson publicly stated that he had no intention of trading nash . more rumors came to light when reports attributed to <unk> des sports stated that carter was unhappy in columbus and demanded a trade . howson , carter and his agent all denied that a trade request was ever made , and they were unsure where the reports were coming from . with the trade deadline approaching , speculation picked up on the blue jackets trading carter . reports were that columbus was trying to trade carter and that he was 100 percent available . <eos> at the halfway point of the season , with the blue jackets barely into double digit wins with an 11 – 25 – 5 record , worst in the league , and sitting 20 points out of playoff position , columbus fired arniel . he was replaced by assistant coach todd richards on an interim basis . richards had previously coached the minnesota wild . he recorded his first coaching victory for the blue jackets in his second game , a 4 – 3 win over the phoenix coyotes . the change in coaching did not change the fortunes of the team , as they reached the all @-@ star break with a 13 – 30 – 6 record . at the break , blue jackets ' owner john p . <unk> sent out a letter to fans stating his understanding of their frustration . he added that action would be taken around the trade deadline , the entry draft and free agency to take the team in a new direction . when speaking of the season , <unk> stated disappointing is not a strong enough word and that he was committed to giving fans a team of which they can be proud of . he also thanked them for their dedication and passion , while reiterating that the team goal was to win consistently and compete for the stanley cup . days later , a 250 @-@ person protest occurred outside of nationwide arena . fans were upset with the blue jackets ' management and were calling for changes at the top . the same day the fans protested , it was announced that the franchise would host the 2013 all @-@ star game . columbus was without a representative for the 2012 all @-@ star game , but ryan johansen represented the club as a rookie participant in the super <unk> competition . in the competition , johansen participated in the <unk> insurance nhl <unk> challenge , a shootout themed event judged by the fans . he received just 1 % of the vote and finished last . <eos> following the break , the blue jackets were on the road playing the los angeles kings , and with the score tied late in the game , kings ' defenseman drew <unk> scored with just 0 @ . @ 4 seconds remaining to win the game . upon review of the goal it , was determined that the clock at staples center froze at 1 @ . @ 8 seconds for over a full second , which would have resulted in time expiring prior to the goal being scored . kings ' general manager dean lombardi stated that the clock was correct and no extra time had been added due to the way the clock self @-@ <unk> at various times . howson stated on the team ' s blog that it is an amazing coincidence that with the kings on a power play at staples center and with a mad scramble around our net in the dying seconds of the third period of a 2 – 2 hockey game that the clock stopped for at least one full second , adding that , either there was a deliberate stopping of the clock or the clock <unk> . nhl senior vice president of hockey operations colin campbell stated that the blue jackets were <unk> , but that the outcome of the game could not be changed , and that the delay was not noticed by the off @-@ ice officials or the situation room in toronto . to determine the true cause of the clock pause , the nhl launched an investigation , talking with the clock ' s manufacturer and interviewing staples center staff . <eos> two weeks prior to the nhl trade deadline , columbus announced that unlike earlier in the season , they would listen to trade proposals involving rick nash , though they were not actively shopping him . howson stated that the team was open to all options for improving the team , including trading nash . <unk> was that in return for nash the blue jackets would ask for a combination of young , proven players , high @-@ end prospects and draft picks . leading up to the trade deadline , the blue jackets dealt antoine <unk> to the phoenix coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender curtis <unk> . despite being injured at the time , the acquisition of <unk> was believed to give columbus the flexibility to trade curtis sanford . the following day , on february 23 , columbus traded jeff carter to the kings . in the deal , columbus acquired defenseman jack johnson and a first @-@ round draft pick the team was given the choice of taking the pick in either 2012 or 2013 . at the deadline , columbus was unable to come to terms on a deal involving nash , but they did make one more move they sent center samuel <unk> to the vancouver canucks in exchange for two fourth @-@ round draft picks and minor league defenseman taylor ellington . following the trade deadline , howson announced that the team had attempted to trade nash at the player ' s request . nash stated that he had requested the trade after being informed that the franchise was going into another rebuilding phase . he further noted that he felt that he could be a huge part of that towards bringing assets in , and in his view it was the best thing for the team , the organization , and personally for [ his ] career . after the personnel changes , the blue jackets closed out the month with a three @-@ game losing streak . <eos> <eos> = = = march – april
